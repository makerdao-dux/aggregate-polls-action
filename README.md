# Aggregate Poll Action

This GitHub action fetches the poll metadata for each poll in the polling DB, parses it, assigns the corresponding tags to each poll, and finally aggregates all of the polls into a single file, writing it to the disk.

## Inputs

### `network`

**Required** The network from which to fetch polls from, either Mainnet or Tenderly. Default: `mainnet`.

### `tags-file`

**Required** The path to the file containing the Poll ID -> Tags mapping, used to assign tags to the polls from the DB. Default: `governance/polls/meta/poll-tags.json`

### `output-file`

**Required** The path and name of the file that will be created containing the aggregated list of polls.

### `hash-file`

**Required** The path and name of the file that will be created containing the hash of the file with the aggregated list of polls.

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: makerdao-dux/aggregate-polls-action@v1.2.4
with:
  network: 'mainnet'
  tags-file: 'governance/polls/meta/poll-tags.json'
  output-file: 'governance/polls/meta/polls.json'
  hash-file: 'governance/polls/meta/hashed-polls.json'
```
